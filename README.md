**Legend:**
- ✅: Feature is explicitly covered or conceptually explained in the tutorial.
- ➖: Feature is not explicitly covered or is not applicable to the tool's primary focus in the tutorial.
- 🛠️: Feature is partially covered, covered via tool-specific means, or conceptually discussed.
- N/A: Not Applicable.

**Notes:**
- All SDKs inherently support the full range of KSM capabilities (listing, getting, creating, updating, deleting records/folders/files). The table reflects what is *emphasized and demonstrated within the tutorial steps* of this repository.
- For CLI tools (KSM CLI), many features are available through their rich command sets, even if not every single one is part of a specific tutorial step.

This matrix should help users navigate to the scenario that best fits their learning goals or integration needs.
