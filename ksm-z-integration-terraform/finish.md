## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've completed the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) Terraform Provider Tutorial!

Throughout these steps, you've learned how to:

- âœ… **Set up** your Terraform environment and configure the KSM provider (`keeper-security/secretsmanager`).
- âœ… **Authenticate** the provider using a KSM configuration (Base64/JSON string).
- âœ… **Retrieve secrets using Data Sources**:
    - Fetch specific typed records (e.g., `secretsmanager_login`).
    - Use the generic `secretsmanager_record` to get any record type.
    - Access standard fields, custom fields, notes, and file attachment details.
    - List folder information using `secretsmanager_folders`.
- âœ… **Manage secrets using Resources**:
    - **Create new records** (e.g., `secretsmanager_login`) with various fields.
    - **Update existing records** by modifying resource attributes.
    - **Delete records** by removing resource blocks from your configuration.
- âœ… **Manage folders**: List folders (`secretsmanager_folders` data source) and create new folders (`secretsmanager_folder` resource).
- âœ… **Manage files**: Upload files (`secretsmanager_file` resource) and attach them to records.
- âœ… **Understand the lifecycle** of secrets managed by Terraform (create, update, delete).
- âœ… **Integrate KSM secrets** with other Terraform resources (e.g., Docker example).
- âœ… **Clean up** resources provisioned by Terraform using `terraform destroy`.

## Next Steps & Best Practices

- **Explore the Official Documentation**: Dive deeper into the [Keeper Secrets Manager Terraform Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Keeper-Security/secretsmanager/latest/docs) on the Terraform Registry for comprehensive details on all available data sources, resources, their arguments, and attributes.
- **Advanced Resource Types**: The provider supports many specific record types as resources (e.g., `secretsmanager_address`, `secretsmanager_bank_card`, `secretsmanager_ssh_keys`). Explore creating and managing these as needed.
- **Error Handling & Debugging**: Pay attention to Terraform plan and apply outputs for errors. Use `terraform validate` to check syntax. For provider-specific issues, check the provider's GitHub repository for known issues or to report new ones.
- **Security in Production**:
    - **Provider Credential**: Use environment variables (e.g., `KEEPER_CREDENTIAL`) or other secure mechanisms to supply the KSM `credential` string to the provider, rather than hardcoding it in your `.tf` files.
    - **Terraform State Security**: Always use a secure backend for your Terraform state files (e.g., Terraform Cloud, HashiCorp Consul, AWS S3 with encryption and access controls). State files can contain sensitive information.
    - **Least Privilege**: Configure your KSM Application with the minimum necessary permissions for the secrets and folders Terraform needs to manage.
    - **Sensitive Data**: Mark outputs containing sensitive information with `sensitive = true`. Be mindful of what gets logged in CI/CD systems.
    - **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit your KSM application permissions and Terraform configurations.
- **Modular Design**: For larger projects, consider organizing your Terraform code into modules. You can create a dedicated module for KSM interactions.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate your Terraform KSM configurations into your CI/CD pipelines for automated secret provisioning and management as part of your infrastructure deployments.

By leveraging the KSM Terraform Provider, you can significantly enhance the security and automation of secret management within your IaC workflows, ensuring that your applications and infrastructure components receive the secrets they need in a secure, auditable, and an automated manner.

Thank you for using Keeper Secrets Manager!
