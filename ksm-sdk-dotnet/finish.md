# Congratulations on Completing the KSM .NET SDK Tutorial!

You've successfully learned the fundamentals of integrating Keeper Secrets Manager into your .NET applications. You are now equipped to:

-   ‚úÖ **Set up and configure** the KSM .NET SDK (`Keeper.SecretsManager`) in your projects.
-   ‚úÖ **Authenticate** your applications securely using One-Time Tokens, local file configuration (`LocalConfigStorage`), or in-memory Base64 configuration strings (`MemoryKeyValueStorage`).
-   ‚úÖ **Retrieve secrets effectively**: Fetch all shared secrets, target specific records by UID or title, and access various field types (standard, custom) and notes.
-   ‚úÖ **Manage Record Lifecycle**:
    -   Create new records (`SecretsManagerClient.CreateSecretAsync()`) with various field types.
    -   Generate strong passwords using `SecretsManagerClient.GeneratePassword()`.
    -   Update existing records (`SecretsManagerClient.UpdateSecretAsync()`).
    -   Delete records (`SecretsManagerClient.DeleteSecretsAsync()`).
-   ‚úÖ **Full File Management**:
    -   Upload files to records (`SecretsManagerClient.UploadFileAsync()`).
    -   Download files from records (`SecretsManagerClient.DownloadFileAsync()`).
    -   Delete files from records (`SecretsManagerClient.DeleteFileAsync()`).
-   ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Folder Management**:
    -   Create new folders (`SecretsManagerClient.CreateFolderAsync()`).
    -   List all folders (`SecretsManagerClient.GetFoldersAsync()`).
    -   Update (rename) folders (`SecretsManagerClient.UpdateFolderAsync()`).
    -   Delete folders (`SecretsManagerClient.DeleteFolderAsync()`).
-   ‚úÖ **Implement Client-Side Caching**: Configure caching via `SecretsManagerOptions` to improve performance.

## Next Steps & Best Practices for Production

As you prepare to use the KSM .NET SDK in production environments, keep these crucial points in mind:

1.  **Secure KSM Configuration**: 
    -   Avoid committing `ksm-config.json` to source control.
    -   For production, prefer `MemoryKeyValueStorage` initialized with a Base64 configuration string passed via secure environment variables or a managed configuration service (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store).
2.  **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize the `async` and `await` patterns available in the SDK for non-blocking secret retrieval, especially in web applications or services.
3.  **Error Handling & Resilience**: Implement robust error handling (try-catch blocks), logging, and potentially retry mechanisms for KSM SDK operations to handle transient network issues or API errors.
4.  **Least Privilege Principle**: Strictly enforce the principle of least privilege. Ensure the KSM application in your Keeper Vault only has the minimum necessary permissions (view, edit, share) for the specific secrets it needs to access.
5.  **Dependency Management**: Keep the `Keeper.SecretsManager` NuGet package updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security updates and new features.
6.  **Caching Strategy**: Evaluate if client-side caching (configurable in `SecretsManagerOptions`) is beneficial for your application's performance profile. Configure cache duration appropriately.
7.  **Audit Trails**: Regularly review audit logs in your Keeper Admin Console to monitor how and when your applications are accessing secrets.
8.  **Testing**: Thoroughly test your KSM integration, including positive and negative test cases (e.g., secret not found, invalid token, network down, permission issues).
