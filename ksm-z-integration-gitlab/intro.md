# Keeper Secrets Manager & GitLab CI/CD Integration

Welcome to the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) GitLab Integration Tutorial! This guide will walk you through integrating KSM into your GitLab CI/CD pipelines for secure and automated secret management.

## Why Use Keeper Secrets Manager with GitLab CI/CD?

GitLab CI/CD enables automation of your software build, test, and deployment processes. These pipelines often require access to sensitive credentials like API keys, database passwords, SSH keys, and other secrets.

Storing secrets directly in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file or as plaintext variables in GitLab is a security risk. Keeper Secrets Manager provides a secure, centralized vault to manage these secrets. By integrating KSM with GitLab CI/CD, your pipelines can dynamically fetch secrets at runtime, avoiding the need to hardcode them or store them insecurely.

### Key Benefits:
- **Enhanced Security**: Secrets are stored and encrypted in your Keeper Vault using a zero-knowledge architecture. They are fetched on-demand by the pipeline job.
- **Centralized Secret Management**: Manage all CI/CD secrets through Keeper's robust platform, with audit trails and access controls.
- **Dynamic Secret Injection**: The KSM configuration (JSON or Base64) is stored as a protected and masked GitLab CI/CD variable. Individual secrets are fetched at runtime from Keeper.
- **Simplified Pipeline Configuration**: Use the Keeper Secrets Manager CLI (`ksm`) within your pipeline scripts to easily retrieve secrets.
- **Compliance and Auditing**: Leverage Keeper's comprehensive auditing capabilities to track secret access within your CI/CD processes.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

1.  **Securely Configure GitLab**: Store your KSM Application Configuration as a protected and masked CI/CD variable in GitLab.
2.  **Install KSM CLI**: Set up your GitLab CI/CD pipeline to install the Keeper Secrets Manager CLI.
3.  **Fetch Secrets**: Use `ksm` commands in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to retrieve various types of secrets (passwords, custom fields, files) from your Keeper Vault and inject them into your pipeline environment.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, you will need:

*   A Keeper Business or Enterprise account with the **Keeper Secrets Manager add-on enabled**.
*   Membership in a Keeper Role that has the **Secrets Manager enforcement policy enabled**.
*   An **initialized KSM Application** (client ID, private key, etc.) in JSON or Base64 format. (Refer to the [Secrets Manager Configuration Guide](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/secrets-manager-configuration) if you need to create one).
*   A GitLab account and a project with access to configure CI/CD settings (specifically, CI/CD variables and the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file).
*   A GitLab Runner configured for your project that can execute jobs using a Docker image with `python3` and `pip` (e.g., the `python:latest` image).

Let's begin by setting up your KSM configuration in GitLab!
