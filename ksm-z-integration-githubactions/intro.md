# Keeper Secrets Manager & GitHub Actions Integration Tutorial

Welcome to the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) GitHub Actions Integration Tutorial! This guide will demonstrate how to securely inject secrets stored in your Keeper Vault into your GitHub Actions workflows.

## Why Use Keeper Secrets Manager with GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows, including CI/CD, testing, and deployments. However, these workflows often require access to sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, SSH keys, and other secrets.

Hardcoding secrets or managing them insecurely within your GitHub repository is a significant security risk. Keeper Secrets Manager provides a secure and centralized platform to manage these secrets, and the KSM GitHub Action allows your workflows to fetch them dynamically at runtime.

### Key Benefits:
- **Enhanced Security**: Secrets are stored securely in your Keeper Vault, encrypted with zero-knowledge architecture. They are only fetched by the GitHub Action when needed and can be injected directly into environment variables, files, or step outputs within the runner.
- **Centralized Management**: Manage all your CI/CD secrets from a single, auditable platform.
- **Dynamic Secret Injection**: The KSM config (JSON or Base64 format) is stored in GitHub secrets, but the individual secrets are fetched on-demand from Keeper at runtime.
- **Rotation and Auditing**: Leverage Keeper's features for secret rotation and maintain a clear audit trail of secret access.
- **Simplified Workflow**: Easy-to-use GitHub Action (`Keeper-Security/ksm-action`) simplifies the process of retrieving secrets.
- **Automatic Masking**: Fetched secrets are automatically masked in GitHub Actions logs to prevent accidental exposure.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

1.  **Configure a KSM Application**: Generate the necessary configuration (JSON or Base64) for your GitHub Action to authenticate with Keeper Secrets Manager.
2.  **Securely Store KSM Configuration**: Add your KSM application configuration as a secret in your GitHub repository.
3.  **Integrate KSM into a GitHub Action**: Use the `Keeper-Security/ksm-action` to fetch secrets from your Keeper Vault.
4.  **Map Secrets**: Understand how to map secrets from Keeper to environment variables, files, or step outputs within your GitHub Actions runner.

## Prerequisites

-   A Keeper Business or Enterprise account with the Keeper Secrets Manager add-on enabled.
-   An existing KSM Application created in your Keeper Vault (or permissions to create one), and its configuration string (JSON or Base64 format).
-   A GitHub account and a repository where you can enable and configure GitHub Actions and manage repository secrets.
-   Familiarity with basic Git and GitHub concepts.
-   Keeper Commander CLI installed on your local machine or in the Katacoda environment (this will be handled by the `install-prereqs.sh` script in the first step).

## Security Best Practices

-   **Least Privilege**: The KSM Application configuration used in GitHub Actions should have the minimum necessary permissions (access only to the specific secrets and folders required by the workflow).
-   **GitHub Secret Management**: Protect your GitHub repository secrets. Use environment-specific secrets if applicable for different deployment targets.
-   **Review Workflow Logs**: While secrets are masked, always be mindful of what your GitHub Actions workflows log. Avoid manually printing fetched secrets.
-   **Action Versioning**: Consider pinning to a specific version of the `Keeper-Security/ksm-action` (e.g., `@vX.Y.Z`) in your workflows for stability, rather than using `@master`.

Let's get started by configuring your KSM application and setting up the necessary GitHub secrets!
