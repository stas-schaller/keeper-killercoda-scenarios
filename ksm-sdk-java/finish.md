# Congratulations on Completing the KSM Java SDK Tutorial!

You've successfully learned how to integrate Keeper Secrets Manager into your Java applications. You now have the skills to:

-   ‚úÖ **Set up and configure** the KSM Java SDK in a Gradle project.
-   ‚úÖ **Authenticate** your applications securely using One-Time Tokens and local configuration storage.
-   ‚úÖ **Retrieve all shared secrets** and fetch specific records by UID or title.
-   ‚úÖ **Access various field types**, custom fields, and notes within your records.
-   ‚úÖ **Create new records and folders** programmatically to manage your secrets dynamically.
-   ‚úÖ **Handle file attachments**: Upload, download, and manage files associated with records.
-   ‚úÖ **Implement advanced configurations** like in-memory storage for ephemeral environments and caching for performance optimization.

## Next Steps & Best Practices

As you move towards production, consider these important steps:

1.  **Secure Configuration Storage**: For production, avoid committing `ksm-config.json`. Instead, use environment variables for the Base64 configuration string with `InMemoryStorage`, or integrate with managed secret stores (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) to store the KSM configuration itself.
2.  **Robust Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and logging around KSM SDK calls.
3.  **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure your KSM application in the Keeper Vault only has access to the secrets it absolutely needs.
4.  **Regular Audits**: Regularly review KSM application permissions and audit logs in your Keeper Admin Console.
5.  **Secret Rotation**: Implement policies and automation for rotating secrets managed by KSM.
6.  **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for your KSM integration to ensure reliability.
7.  **Stay Updated**: Keep your KSM Java SDK dependency updated to the latest version for security patches and new features.
