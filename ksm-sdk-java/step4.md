# Step 4: File Attachments & Management

Keeper Secrets Manager allows you to securely store and manage file attachments associated with your records. This step covers uploading, downloading, and listing file attachments using the KSM Java SDK.

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

-   Ensure you have a working `ksm-config.json`.
-   You will need the UID of an existing record where your KSM application has **"Can Edit"** permission (to upload files) and **"Can View"** permission (to download/list files).
-   Create a sample file in your project directory to upload, e.g., `sample-attachment.txt`.

```bash
echo "This is a sample file for KSM Java SDK attachment testing." > sample-attachment.txt
ls -l sample-attachment.txt
```
`echo "This is a sample file for KSM Java SDK attachment testing." > sample-attachment.txt && ls -l sample-attachment.txt`{{execute}}

## 2. Create Java Class: ManageFileAttachments

```bash
touch src/main/java/com/keepersecurity/ksmsdk/javatutorial/ManageFileAttachments.java
```
`touch src/main/java/com/keepersecurity/ksmsdk/javatutorial/ManageFileAttachments.java`{{execute}}

### Add the Java Code

Paste the following code into `src/main/java/com/keepersecurity/ksmsdk/javatutorial/ManageFileAttachments.java`:

## 3. Configure Target Record UID

-   In `ManageFileAttachments.java`:
    -   **Crucial**: Replace `[YOUR_RECORD_UID_FOR_FILES]` with the UID of an existing record in your Keeper Vault where your KSM application has appropriate permissions (Edit for upload, View for list/download).
    -   If needed, update `[ONE_TIME_TOKEN_IF_NEEDED]`.

## 4. Run the Application

```bash
gradle -PmainClass=com.keepersecurity.ksmsdk.javatutorial.ManageFileAttachments run --console=plain
```
`gradle -PmainClass=com.keepersecurity.ksmsdk.javatutorial.ManageFileAttachments run --console=plain`{{execute}}

### Expected Output:

```
üöÄ Managing file attachments...

--- Uploading File ---
üìé Uploading 'sample-attachment.txt' with title 'SDK Uploaded - sample-attachment.txt' to record UID: YOUR_RECORD_UID_FOR_FILES
‚úÖ File uploaded successfully!

--- Listing Files for Record ---
üìÑ Files attached to record 'Your Record Title' (UID: YOUR_RECORD_UID_FOR_FILES):
    - Title: SDK Uploaded - sample-attachment.txt (Name: sample-attachment.txt, UID: ..., Size: ..., Type: text/plain)
    ...

--- Downloading File ---
üì• Downloading file with Title: 'SDK Uploaded - sample-attachment.txt' (UID: ...)
‚úÖ File downloaded successfully to: downloaded-sample.txt
    Size: ... bytes

üéâ File management operations complete. Check your Keeper Vault and local directory for results.
```

**Verify**: 
- Check the target record in your Keeper Vault; the new file `SDK Uploaded - sample-attachment.txt` should be attached.
- Check your project directory; the file `downloaded-sample.txt` should exist and contain the content of `sample-attachment.txt`.

## Understanding the Code

-   **`KeeperFileUpload`**: This class is used to prepare a file for uploading. You provide the `name` (original filename), `title` (display name in Keeper), `type` (MIME type, optional), and the file `data` as a byte array.
-   **`SecretsManager.uploadFile(options, record, fileUploadData)`**: Uploads the prepared file to the specified `KeeperRecord`.
    -   The `record` object must be an up-to-date instance of `KeeperRecord` (it's good practice to fetch it just before upload if you don't already have it).
-   **Listing Files**: After fetching a `KeeperRecord`, its `getFiles()` method returns a `List<KeeperFile>`. Each `KeeperFile` object has:
    -   `getFileUid()`: The unique ID of the file attachment.
    -   `getData()`: Returns a `KeeperFileData` object which contains metadata like `name`, `title`, `size`, and `type`.
-   **`SecretsManager.downloadFile(options, keeperFile)`**: Downloads the specified `KeeperFile` and returns its content as a byte array.

## Important Notes on File Handling

-   **Permissions**: Ensure your KSM application has "Can Edit" permission on the record to upload files and "Can View" to list/download files.
-   **File Size Limits**: Keeper has limits on the size of individual file attachments, which may depend on your subscription plan. The SDK might also impose practical limits for very large files due to memory constraints during upload/download.
-   **Error Handling**: Always include robust error handling for file operations (e.g., file not found, network issues, permission denied).

## Next Steps

In the final step of this tutorial, you'll explore advanced configuration options, including in-memory storage for KSM configuration and secret caching for improved performance.
