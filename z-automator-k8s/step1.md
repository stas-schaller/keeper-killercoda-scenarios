### Create Secret to store KSM Config Base64
 
Create regular Kubernetes Secret to store KSM Config Base64 
that will be used by External Secrets to authenticate against Keeper Security.

> Replace [KSM CONFIG] with the Base64 encoded KSM Config

```shell
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ksm-config-secret                 # name of the k8s Secret where KSM config is stored
type: Opaque
data:
  ksm_config: "[KSM CONFIG]"                # Base64 encoded KSM Config
EOF
```{{copy}}


### Create SecretStore and ExternalSecret

> Replace [SHARED FOLDER UID] with the UID of the shared folder in Keeper Security where the records are stored.

```shell
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1   
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: my-external-secrets-secretstore   # name of the SecretStore where retrieved secrets will be stored once fetched from Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM)
spec:
  provider:
    keepersecurity:                       # name of the SecretStore provider, in this case KeeperSecurity
      authRef:
        name: ksm-config-secret           # name of the k8s Secret where KSM config is stored
        key: ksm_config                   # key in the k8s Secret where KSM config is stored
      folderID: "[SHARED FOLDER UID]"     # UID of the shared folder in KeeperSecurity where the records 
                                          #   are stored. Make sure the folder is shared into the KSM Application
EOF
```{{copy}}

> Replace [RECORD UID] with the UID of the record in Keeper Security where the secrets are stored.

```shell
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
 name: ksm-external-secret
spec:
 refreshInterval: 30s                     # rate how often SecretManager pulls KeeperSecurity.
