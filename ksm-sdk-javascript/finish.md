## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've completed the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) JavaScript SDK Tutorial!

Throughout these steps, you've learned how to:

- âœ… **Set up** your Node.js project and install the KSM SDK (`@keeper-security/secrets-manager-core`).
- âœ… **Authenticate** with Keeper using One-Time Tokens, configuration files, or Base64 encoded configuration strings (for in-memory setup).
- âœ… **Retrieve secrets**: List all records, get specific records by UID or title, and access various field types (standard, custom, notes).
- âœ… **Create new records** with different field types using SDK helper classes (e.g., `LoginField`, `PasswordField`) and leverage the `generatePassword()` utility.
- âœ… **Update existing records**.
- âœ… **Manage file attachments**: Upload files to records (`uploadFile`), download files from records (`downloadFile`), and remove file references by updating the record's `fileRef` field.
- âœ… **Delete entire records** securely using `deleteSecret()`.
- âœ… **Work with folders**: Create (`createFolder`), list (`getFolders`), rename (`updateFolder`), and delete (`deleteFolder`) folders to organize your secrets.
- âœ… **Use In-Memory Configuration** for the KSM client using `loadJsonConfig()` with a Base64 string.
- âœ… Implement a **Client-Side Caching** mechanism in a Node.js environment using `cachingPostFunction`.

## Next Steps & Best Practices

- **Explore the Official Documentation**: Dive deeper into the `@keeper-security/secrets-manager-core` SDK documentation for comprehensive details on all available functions, their precise signatures, advanced capabilities, and all supported field types/classes.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your production applications. Check for network issues, invalid UIDs, permission problems, API errors, etc.
- **Security**:
    - Always use the principle of least privilege for your KSM applications.
    - Securely manage your KSM configuration (file or Base64 string). Consider environment variables for Base64 strings in production.
    - Regularly rotate tokens and review application permissions.
- **Asynchronous Nature**: Remember that most KSM SDK operations are asynchronous. Make proper use of `async/await` or Promises.
- **Idempotency**: Consider idempotency for operations like creation or updates if your application might retry them.
- **Configuration Management**: For production, using environment variables to supply the Base64 KSM configuration to `loadJsonConfig` is often a more secure approach than config files.
- **Integrate into your Applications**: Apply what you've learned to securely manage secrets in your Node.js projects, CI/CD pipelines, serverless functions, or other automated workflows.

By leveraging the KSM JavaScript SDK, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your applications by eliminating hardcoded secrets and adopting a secure, centralized secret management solution.

Thank you for using Keeper Secrets Manager!
