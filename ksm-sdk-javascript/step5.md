### Step 5: Folders, In-Memory Config & Caching

This final step explores folder management (creating, listing, updating, deleting), using in-memory configuration, and implementing client-side caching.

### 1. Create Script: `manage_folders_config_cache.js`

// Option 2: Provide the UID of the root/shared folder for your application context
// This is the folder shared with your KSM App, under which other folders/records will be managed.
// If using createFolder at the top level for your app, this is required for the `createOptions.folderUid`.

### 2. Configure Placeholders

- In `manage_folders_config_cache.js`:
    - Replace `[ONE_TIME_TOKEN_IF_NEEDED]` if you intend to initialize/re-initialize file-based config (`myksmconfig.json`).
    - **For In-Memory Configuration**: Replace `[YOUR_KSM_CONFIG_BASE64_STRING_HERE]` with the actual Base64 encoded configuration string for your KSM application from the Keeper Vault.
    - **Crucially for Folder Creation**: Replace `[YOUR_APP_ROOT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID]` with the UID of the main Shared Folder that your KSM Application has access to. New top-level folders created by the script will be under this root shared folder.

### 3. Execute the Script

`node manage_folders_config_cache.js`{{execute}}

This script will:
1. Initialize KSM using in-memory (if Base64 config is provided) or file-based configuration.
2. Perform folder operations: create, list, rename (update), and create a record within the new folder.
3. Demonstrate a basic client-side caching mechanism for `getSecrets` (specific to Node.js using `cachingPostFunction`).
4. Clean up by attempting to delete the folder created during the script.

Review the output and check your Keeper Vault to see the folder and record manipulations.
