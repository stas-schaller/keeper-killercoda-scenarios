## Congratulations! You've Mastered KSM with PowerShell! ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully completed the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) PowerShell Plugin tutorial.

Here's a recap of what you've learned:

- âœ… **Installation**: How to install the `Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement` module, the `SecretManagement.Keeper` extension, and a local vault extension like `Microsoft.Powershell.SecretStore`.
- âœ… **Vault Registration**: How to register a local vault for storing KSM configuration and then register your Keeper Vault using a One-Time Token or Base64 configuration.
- âœ… **Default Vault**: How to set your Keeper Vault as the default for PowerShell Secret Management cmdlets.
- âœ… **Secret Retrieval**: Using `Get-SecretInfo` to list secrets and `Get-Secret` (with and without `-AsPlainText`) to fetch full secret records or specific field/custom field values using dot notation.
- âœ… **Secret Updates**: Using `Set-Secret` to update values within your Keeper Vault (given appropriate permissions).
- âœ… **File Downloads**: How to download files attached to Keeper records using `Get-Secret` and `Set-Content`.
- âœ… **Cleanup**: How to unregister vaults and uninstall the modules if needed.

By integrating Keeper Secrets Manager with PowerShell, you can write more secure scripts and automate tasks without hardcoding sensitive credentials, leveraging Keeper's robust security model for your secrets.

## Next Steps & Further Resources

-   **Explore Dot Notation**: Familiarize yourself further with [Keeper Dot Notation](https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/secrets-manager/about/keeper-notation) for advanced ways to access specific fields, custom fields, and file metadata.
-   **PowerShell SecretManagement Module**: For more in-depth information on PowerShell's SecretManagement module, refer to [Microsoft's official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.secretmanagement/?view=ps-modules).
-   **Advanced Scripting**: Think about how you can incorporate these cmdlets into your more complex PowerShell automation scripts for tasks like server configuration, application deployment, and more.
-   **KSM Application Permissions**: Always follow the principle of least privilege when configuring KSM Applications for use with PowerShell scripts. Grant only the necessary access to secrets and folders.
