Enhance all SDK Katacoda tutorials with comprehensive features.

This commit significantly expands the Katacoda tutorials for all Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) SDKs (JavaScript, Go, Python, Java, .NET) to cover a more complete set of functionalities. The main README.md feature matrix has also been updated to accurately reflect these additions.

Key enhancements across SDK tutorials include:

*   **Authentication & Configuration:**
    *   Demonstrated Base64/In-Memory configuration for all SDKs, providing an alternative to file-based config, suitable for containerized/serverless environments.

*   **Record Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Added examples for updating existing records (modifying fields, notes).
    *   Added examples for deleting records.
    *   Integrated password generation utilities provided by each SDK during record creation.

*   **File Management:**
    *   Ensured comprehensive file operations are covered: uploading to records, downloading from records, and deleting files from records.

*   **Folder Management:**
    *   Added full folder lifecycle examples: creating new folders, listing folders, updating (renaming) folders, and deleting folders.

*   **Client-Side Caching:**
    *   Implemented or clarified client-side caching mechanisms for each SDK to improve performance.

*   **Tutorial Structure & Metadata:**
    *   Refactored steps within each SDK tutorial for better logical flow where necessary.
    *   Added new steps (e.g., step4.md for .NET) to accommodate the expanded content.
    *   Updated `intro.md`, `finish.md` (created if missing), and `index.json` files for each SDK to reflect the new comprehensive scope, titles, and descriptions.

*   **README.md Feature Matrix:**
    *   The main KSM Scenarios Feature Matrix in `README.md` has been meticulously updated. All newly added and verified features for each SDK are now marked with 'âœ…', ensuring the matrix accurately represents the tutorial content.
    *   Notes within the README have been updated to indicate the comprehensive nature of the SDK tutorials.

These changes aim to provide users with more thorough and practical learning experiences for integrating Keeper Secrets Manager into their applications using their preferred SDK.
