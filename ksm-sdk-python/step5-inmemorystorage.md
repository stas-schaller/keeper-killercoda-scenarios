# Step 5: Folder Management & Record Deletion

This step focuses on managing folders (creating, listing, updating, deleting) and deleting entire records using the KSM Python SDK. Client-side caching, which was also part of the original Step 5, is demonstrated here as well as it's often used with these operations.

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

- Ensure you have a `ksm-config.json` from previous steps (or a valid One-Time Token for initial setup).
- Have the UID of a Shared Folder where your KSM application has **"Can Edit"** permissions. This will be the parent for new folders created by the script.

## 2. Create Script for Folder & Record Management

```bash
# You can reuse main.py or create a new file like main_manage_folders_records.py
touch main.py
```
`touch main.py`{{execute}}

## 3. Add Code for Folder and Record Operations

Copy and paste this code into your Python script (e.g., `main.py`):

```python
import os
import time
from keeper_secrets_manager_core import SecretsManager
from keeper_secrets_manager_core.storage import FileKeyValueStorage
from keeper_secrets_manager_core.options import SecretsManagerOptions
from keeper_secrets_manager_core.cache import InMemoryCache
from keeper_secrets_manager_core.dto.dtos import RecordCreate, RecordField # For creating a test record

# Initialize Secrets Manager (assuming ksm-config.json exists or token is provided for initial setup)
ONE_TIME_TOKEN_STEP5 = os.environ.get("KSM_ONE_TIME_TOKEN_STEP5", "[ONE_TIME_TOKEN_IF_NEEDED]")
CONFIG_FILE_NAME = "ksm-config.json"

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace with UID of a Shared Folder with "Can Edit" permissions for your KSM App
# This will serve as the parent for folders created in this demo.
PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID = os.environ.get("KSM_PARENT_FOLDER_UID_STEP5", "[YOUR_PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID_HERE]")

# Setup Caching (optional, but good practice)
app_cache = InMemoryCache()
options = SecretsManagerOptions(
    token=ONE_TIME_TOKEN_STEP5 if not os.path.exists(CONFIG_FILE_NAME) and ONE_TIME_TOKEN_STEP5 != "[ONE_TIME_TOKEN_IF_NEEDED]" else None,
    config=FileKeyValueStorage(CONFIG_FILE_NAME),
    cache=app_cache,
    cache_period=300 # Cache for 5 minutes (300 seconds)
)
secrets_manager = SecretsManager(options=options)

        created_folder_details = secrets_manager.create_folder(folder_name=new_folder_name, parent_uid=PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID)
        new_folder_uid = created_folder_details.get('folder_uid')

### 4. Configure Required Parameters

-   **`[ONE_TIME_TOKEN_IF_NEEDED]`**: If `ksm-config.json` doesn't exist, replace this (or set `KSM_ONE_TIME_TOKEN_STEP5` env var) for initial setup.
-   **`[YOUR_PARENT_SHARED_FOLDER_UID_HERE]`**: **Crucial!** Replace this placeholder (or set `KSM_PARENT_FOLDER_UID_STEP5` env var) with the UID of a Shared Folder in your Keeper Vault where your KSM Application has **"Can Edit"** permissions. This folder will act as the parent for the new folder created in this script.

### 5. Run the Script

```bash
python3 main.py # or your chosen filename
```
`python3 main.py`{{execute}}

## Understanding the Code

-   **Caching (`InMemoryCache`, `SecretsManagerOptions`)**: 
    -   An `InMemoryCache` is instantiated.
    -   `SecretsManagerOptions` is used to pass the `cache` object and `cache_period` (in seconds) to the `SecretsManager`.
-   **Folder Creation (`secrets_manager.create_folder`)**: 
    -   Takes `folder_name` and an optional `parent_uid`.
    -   `parent_uid` is the UID of the shared folder context or another folder UID if nesting.
-   **Listing Folders (`secrets_manager.get_folders_all()`)**: Retrieves all folders accessible by the KSM application.
-   **Updating Folders (`secrets_manager.update_folder`)**: Takes `folder_uid` and the new `folder_name` to rename it.
-   **Record Deletion (`secrets_manager.delete_secrets([list_of_uids])`)**: Deletes one or more records given their UIDs.
-   **Folder Deletion (`secrets_manager.delete_folder(folder_uid)`)**: Deletes the specified folder. Note: The folder might need to be empty first for successful deletion, depending on Keeper's backend rules and SDK behavior (the Python SDK does not expose a direct "force delete" flag for non-empty folders).

## Conclusion

This step demonstrated how to manage the lifecycle of folders and records, including creation, listing, updating, and deletion, using the KSM Python SDK, along with setting up client-side caching for improved performance.
