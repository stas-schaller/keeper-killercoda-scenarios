# Keeper Secrets Manager Python SDK Tutorial

Welcome to the Keeper Secrets Manager Python SDK Tutorial! 

## What is Keeper Secrets Manager SDK?

The Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) Python SDK provides a powerful, secure way to integrate your Python applications with Keeper's zero-knowledge security platform. It allows you to:

- **Retrieve secrets programmatically** from your Keeper vault.
- **Create, update, and delete records** directly from your applications.
- **Generate strong passwords** for new records.
- **Upload, download, and delete files/attachments** securely.
- **Create, list, update, and delete folders** for organization.
- **Cache secrets** for improved performance.
- **Use multiple storage backends** (file-based, in-memory using Base64 configuration).

## What You'll Learn

In this interactive tutorial, you will:

1.  **Connect to Keeper**: Set up authentication with file-based and in-memory configurations.
2.  **Implement Caching**: Improve performance with intelligent caching and advanced retrieval techniques.
3.  **Create Records**: Programmatically create and update secrets with password generation.
4.  **File Operations**: Upload, download, and manage file attachments securely.
5.  **Advanced Features**: Folder management and enterprise-level organizational patterns.

## Prerequisites

-   A Keeper Security account with Secrets Manager enabled.
-   Basic familiarity with Python programming.
-   Access to your KSM Application's configuration (One-Time Token or Base64 string) and the UID of a Shared Folder it has access to (for folder/record creation).
-   **Test credentials only** (this is a learning environment).

## Key Features You'll Explore

- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: End-to-end encrypted secret access.
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Token-based, file-based config, and in-memory Base64 config.
- **Flexible Storage Options**: File and memory storage backends.
- **Full Record Lifecycle**: Create, read, update, and delete secrets programmatically.
- **Password Generation**: Utility to create strong, random passwords.
- **Comprehensive File Operations**: Upload, download, and delete file attachments.
- **Full Folder Management**: Create, list, update (rename), and delete folders.
- **Performance Optimization**: Built-in caching.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

**DO NOT USE YOUR PRODUCTION CREDENTIALS IN ANY OF THESE EXAMPLES**

This is a learning environment. Always use test accounts and dummy data for educational purposes. Never enter your real production passwords or sensitive information in tutorial environments.
