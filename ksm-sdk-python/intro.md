# Keeper Secrets Manager Python SDK Tutorial

Welcome to the Keeper Secrets Manager Python SDK Tutorial! 

## What is Keeper Secrets Manager SDK?

The Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) Python SDK provides a powerful, secure way to integrate your Python applications with Keeper's zero-knowledge security platform. It allows you to:

- **Retrieve secrets programmatically** from your Keeper vault
- **Create and manage records** directly from your applications  
- **Upload files and attachments** securely
- **Cache secrets** for improved performance
- **Use multiple storage backends** (file-based, in-memory)

## What You'll Learn

In this interactive tutorial, you will:

1. **Connect to Keeper** - Set up basic authentication and retrieve secrets
2. **Implement caching** - Improve performance with intelligent caching
3. **Create records** - Programmatically add new secrets to your vault
4. **Handle file uploads** - Attach files to your secret records
5. **Use in-memory storage** - Deploy with configuration strings instead of files

## Prerequisites

- A Keeper Security account with Secrets Manager enabled
- Basic familiarity with Python programming
- **Test credentials only** (this is a learning environment)

## Key Features You'll Explore

- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: End-to-end encrypted secret access
- **Multiple Authentication Methods**: Token-based and config-based access
- **Flexible Storage Options**: File, memory, and custom storage backends
- **Record Management**: Create, read, update secrets programmatically
- **File Operations**: Upload and manage file attachments
- **Performance Optimization**: Built-in caching and connection pooling

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

**DO NOT USE YOUR PRODUCTION CREDENTIALS IN ANY OF THESE EXAMPLES**

This is a learning environment. Always use test accounts and dummy data for educational purposes. Never enter your real production passwords or sensitive information in tutorial environments.

Let's get started by setting up your KSM Python SDK environment!
