# Keeper Secrets Manager Go SDK Tutorial

Welcome to the official tutorial for the Keeper Secrets Manager (KSM) Go SDK! This guide is designed to help Go developers integrate robust secret management into their applications using Keeper's zero-knowledge platform.

## What is the KSM Go SDK?

The KSM Go SDK enables your Go applications to securely access and manage secrets stored in your Keeper Vault. It provides a native Go interface to interact with KSM, ensuring that sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, certificates, and other confidential information is handled securely throughout its lifecycle.

### Key Features:
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: Secrets are always encrypted and decrypted locally within your application. Keeper never has access to your plaintext data.
- **Native Go Implementation**: Designed to feel natural for Go developers, using idiomatic Go patterns and practices.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports initialization via One-Time Tokens for easy setup, local configuration files for persistent applications, and in-memory configuration (via Base64 encoded string) for ephemeral environments.
- **Comprehensive Secret Management**: Retrieve, create, update, and delete records.
- **File Attachment Support**: Securely upload, download, and delete files attached to your Keeper records.
- **Folder Management**: Create, list, update (rename), and delete folders to organize secrets.
- **Password Generation**: Utility to generate strong, random passwords.
- **Client-Side Caching**: Improve performance by caching secrets locally with configurable file or memory-based caches.
- **Go Modules Compatible**: Easily integrate into your Go projects using `go get`.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this tutorial, you will gain the skills to:

1.  **Set up your Go environment** and add the KSM Go SDK as a dependency.
2.  **Authenticate** your Go application with Keeper using a One-Time Token, a stored configuration file, or an in-memory Base64 configuration string.
3.  **Retrieve secrets**: Fetch all secrets, query for specific records by UID or title, and access individual field values.
4.  **Create new records** with various field types and generate strong passwords.
5.  **Update existing records** and their fields.
6.  **Delete records** securely from the vault.
7.  **Manage file attachments**: Upload, download, and delete files associated with records.
8.  **Organize secrets with folders**: Create, list, rename, and delete folders.
9.  **Implement advanced configurations**, including in-memory storage and client-side caching (file-based or memory-based).

## Prerequisites

-   Basic understanding of Go programming language and its module system.
-   Go (latest stable version recommended) installed on your system.
-   A Keeper Business or Enterprise account with the Secrets Manager add-on enabled.
-   Access to your KSM Application's configuration (One-Time Token or Base64 string) and the UID of a Shared Folder it has access to (for folder/record creation).
-   **Crucial**: For this tutorial, please use a **test Keeper account or non-production credentials**. Do not use your live production secrets in this learning environment.

## Security Best Practices Reminder

-   **Never Hardcode Secrets**: Always retrieve secrets at runtime using the SDK.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Configure your KSM application in the Keeper Vault to only have access to the specific secrets it requires.
-   **Secure Configuration**: If using a local configuration file, ensure it has restrictive file permissions. For production, prefer in-memory configuration from secure environment variables holding the Base64 string.
-   **Audit Trails**: Regularly monitor the audit logs in your Keeper Admin Console to track secret access by your Go applications.

Let's begin by setting up your Go project and establishing a secure connection to Keeper Secrets Manager!
