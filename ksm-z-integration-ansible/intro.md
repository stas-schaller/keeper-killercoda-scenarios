# Keeper Secrets Manager Integration with Ansible

Welcome to the comprehensive tutorial on integrating Keeper Secrets Manager with Ansible!

## What is Ansible + KSM Integration?

This integration combines the power of **Ansible's automation capabilities** with **Keeper's zero-knowledge security platform** to create secure, scalable infrastructure automation.

### Why Use KSM with Ansible?

- **Secure Secret Management**: Store passwords, API keys, and certificates securely in Keeper
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Secrets are encrypted end-to-end, even Keeper can't see them
- **Centralized Control**: Manage all automation secrets from one secure location
- **Audit Trail**: Track when and how secrets are accessed in your automation
- **Role-Based Access**: Control which playbooks can access which secrets
- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Fetch secrets at runtime without hardcoding credentials

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you will:

1. **Install and Configure** Ansible with the KSM plugin
2. **Set up Authentication** between Ansible and Keeper
3. **Create Secure Playbooks** that retrieve secrets dynamically
4. **Implement Best Practices** for production automation
5. **Handle Advanced Scenarios** like file uploads and complex configurations

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Server Provisioning**: Securely deploy servers with database passwords
- **Application Deployment**: Retrieve API keys and certificates during deployment
- **Configuration Management**: Update application configs with fresh secrets
- **Database Operations**: Connect to databases using securely stored credentials
- **Cloud Automation**: Use cloud provider credentials stored in Keeper

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Ansible playbooks and YAML
- A Keeper Security account with Secrets Manager enabled
- **Test environment only** (this is a learning environment)
